# XSSscanner

A messy and not optimized web application that just do his work	correctly and in just 50 seconds.

This is a free software, do everythig you want, modify it, change it, share it, BUT:

	Be conscious!	
	You can test a site only if you are the owner or if the owner formally asks you!
	I do not take any responsibility of your usage. 

This app work only with a site that has form, a site without form will stall this app.

First install nodeJS if you do not already have it, and then run:
	
	$node server.js

so just type on your browser:

	localhost:5050

Now in front of you there is a very user-friendly and immediate interface, 
you will understand immediately where you have to copy the target site URI. 


This app only accept link with this form:
	
	http://example.com
	https://example.com
	www.example.com
	example.com

This form with the "/" at the end will not work: 

	This is no good:   {everything}.com/    



If you have a really slow or busy network this application may not work.


This is the web interface:
